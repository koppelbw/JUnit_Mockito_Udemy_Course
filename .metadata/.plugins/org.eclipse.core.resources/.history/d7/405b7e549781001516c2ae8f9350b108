Section 2: Introduction
-----------------------
[3] - "Unit Testing Introduction"
 
	Unit Testing: 
		Testing at the class level. Test all the public methods on a class. Testing positive and exception options.
		Assures quality.
		Runs very fast.
		Regression Suite. We ensure that any other changes made by another Dev will not break your code.
		
	J2EE flow:
		OrderProcessor -> OrderService -> OrderDAO -> DB
		We wont be testing all the way down the line with unit tests, we will test each class individually.
		We can use Mocks to do this.

Section 3: JUnit in Action
--------------------------
[4] - "Useless 24s video..."

[5]	- "JUnit Introduction"
	
	API: JUnit 4
		Uses Annotations
			@Test
			@Before - ran BEFORE EACH test method
			@After - ran AFTER EACH test method
			@BeforeClass - ran only ONCE BEFORE the tests
			@Ignore - ignores the test
			
			
	Assert results:
		assertNotNull()
		assertNull()
		assertTrue()
		assertEquals()
		assertSame()
		etc..
	
		
	Run and Report results:
		BlockJunit4ClassRunner.class
		@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
	
	
[6] - "Hello JUnit"

	@Test
	assertNotNull(); assertEquals()


[7] - "Testing for Exceptions"

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
	

[8] - "@Before and @After"

	@Before
		Ran before each test method. Used for setup
	
	@After
		Ran after each test method. Used for cleanup

Section 4: Mockito in Action

[10] - "Mocking Introduction"

	Mock: mimic or imitate
	The Mock object will take place of the real object. We want to test our code without the dependencies.
	Each unit is tested on it's own, and once all are working they will work together.
	
	OrderProcessor -> OrderService -> OrderDAO -> DB
		We wont be testing all the way down the line with unit tests, we will test each class individually.
	
	Mockito provides 3 important steps
	----------------------------------	
	Stub -> @Mock
	Setting Expectations -> when, thenReturn, thenThrow
	Verify -> verify, matchers, etc.


[11] - "The Order Processor Usecase"
[12] - "Create the DAO layer"
[13] - "Create the BO layer"
[14] - "Add the Mockito Dependency"


[15] - "Stubbing and Setting Expectations"k 

	Mock -> @Mock
		
	Set Expectations -> when().andReturn()
				
		
[16] - "Verifying the results"

	Mockito.verify() -> checks that the method we specify is called once
	This tests to see if the Mock method is actually getting called

Section 5: Test Coverage
-------------------------

[23] - "Introduction"
[24] - "Test Coverage"
	Number of lines of code that is tested when we run our Tests.

[25] - "EclEmma Installation"
[26] - "Measuring coverage using Emma"
[27] - "Improving the Coverage"

Section 6: More Mockito
------------------------
[29] - "Verification Mode"
	Mockito.verify(dao, Mockito.times(1));
	
[30] - "Verify More"
	Matchers class
	Mockito.anyInt()
	Mockito.any(Order.class)
