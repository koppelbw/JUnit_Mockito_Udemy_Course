Section 2: Introduction
-----------------------
[3] - "Unit Testing Introduction"
 
	Unit Testing: 
		Testing at the class level. Test all the public methods on a class. Testing positive and exception options.
		Assures quality.
		Runs very fast.
		Regression Suite. We ensure that any other changes made by another Dev will not break your code.
		
	J2EE flow:
		OrderProcessor -> OrderService -> OrderDAO -> DB
		We wont be testing all the way down the line with unit tests, we will test each class individually.
		We can use Mocks to do this.

--------------------------
Section 3: JUnit in Action
--------------------------
[4] - "Useless 24s video..."

[5]	- "JUnit Introduction"
	
	API: JUnit 4
		Uses Annotations
			@Test
			@Before - ran BEFORE EACH test method
			@After - ran AFTER EACH test method
			@BeforeClass - ran only ONCE BEFORE the tests
			@Ignore - ignores the test
			
			
	Assert results:
		assertNotNull()
		assertNull()
		assertTrue()
		assertEquals()
		assertSame()
		etc..
	
		
	Run and Report results:
		BlockJunit4ClassRunner.class
		@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
	
	
[6] - "Hello JUnit"

	@Test
	assertNotNull(); assertEquals()


[7] - "Testing for Exceptions"

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
	

[8] - "@Before and @After"

	@Before
		Ran before each test method. Used for setup
	
	@After
		Ran after each test method. Used for cleanup

Section 4: Mockito in Action
--------------------------

[9] - "useless 22s video"


[10] - "Mocking Introduction"

	Mock: mimic or imitate
	The Mock object will take place of the real object. We want to test our code without the dependencies.
	Each unit is tested on it's own, and once all are working they will work together.
	
	OrderProcessor -> OrderService -> OrderDAO -> DB
		We wont be testing all the way down the line with unit tests, we will test each class individually.
	
	Mockito provides 3 important steps
	----------------------------------	
	Stub -> @Mock
	Setting Expectations -> when, thenReturn, thenThrow
	Verify -> verify, matchers, etc.


[11] - "The Order Processor Usecase"
[12] - "Create the DAO layer"
[13] - "Create the BO layer"
[14] - "Add the Mockito Dependency"


[15] - "Stubbing and Setting Expectations"k 

	Mock -> @Mock
		
	Set Expectations -> when().andReturn()
				
		
[16] - "Verifying the results"

	Mockito.verify() -> checks that the method we specify is called once
	This tests to see if the Mock method is actually getting called

Section 5: Test Coverage
-------------------------

[23] - "Introduction"
[24] - "Test Coverage"
	Number of lines of code that is tested when we run our Tests.

[25] - "EclEmma Installation"
[26] - "Measuring coverage using Emma"
[27] - "Improving the Coverage"


------------------------
Section 6: More Mockito
------------------------
[29] - "Verification Mode"
	Mockito.verify(dao, Mockito.times(1));
	
[30] - "Verify More"
	Matchers class
	Mockito.anyInt()
	Mockito.any(Order.class)
	https://mockito.googlecode.com/hg-history/1.5/javadoc/org/mockito/Matchers.html

----------------------------------
Section 7: The F.I.R.S.T Principle
----------------------------------
[36]
	FAST:			 Should finish within milliseconds so we can run many times
	INDEPENDANT: 	 Tests don't depend on tests
	REPEATABLE: 	 Can run on any environment. Develop/QA/UAT
	SELF-VALIDATING: Boolean result. Succeed or Fail.
	TIMELY:			 Should write tests while writing code
	

------------------------------------
Section 8: Maven & JUnit Quick Start
------------------------------------
[37] - "Maven Overview"
	Convention over Configuration. So if we keep projects setup the same way, maven can compile and build the project easily
	Creates a WAR file.
	Plugin based architecture.
	pom.xml config file
	
[38] - "Creating a Maven Project"

[39] - "Running Tests"


------------------------------
Section 9: Parameterized JUnit
------------------------------
	*****	Calculator Project	*****
	
[40]
	Multi parameter tests
	assert for multiple results
	
	Identity the Input data and Results
	Create global fields in the test class
	Create a constructor
	Create a static method that will feed to data
	Create or Update teh test method
	@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
	
[41] - "Create the Fields and Constructor"
[42]
[43]
[44] - "Parameterized Test Flow"
	The JUnit will know to use the Parameterized class by the @RunWith(Parameterized.class) call.
	The Parameterized class knows to invoke the static method marked with the @Paramaters annotation.
		Uses the Data set to create an instance of our class by calling the Constructor with the data.

Section 10: PowerMock Jump Start
--------------------------------
	*****	UserAdminService Project	*****
	
[45] - "PowerMock Introduction"
	Mockito Limitations: Static, Final, Constructors, Private, Enums
	Superset of Mockito, without limitations by using bytecode manipulations
	Similar syntax to Mockito

[46] - "Our Usecase Planning"
[47] - "Create the Project"
[48] - "Download and Add PowerMock Dependencies
[49] - "Prepare for Testing
